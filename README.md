# Welcome to the backend of "e-mercado"

I use Prisma as ORM, Express for server and Node.js.

First install the dependences needed with **npm install** and then run the server with **npm run dev**

All the models has their own readme to make the reading easier in the folder "documentation".

### .ENV

This are the items that are needed in the .env file

- DATABASE_URL : This is expecting the whole url of the database choosed
- PORT : This is wating for the port 


Comandos para el generar la base de datos en PRISMA:
- npx prisma generate
- npx prisma db push
